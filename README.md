# PICLAB
A GitHub repository made for controlling the instruments in the photonics lab at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aarhus University. 
Here the Photonic group can share and store code and data used during different projects.

The repository includes a GUI specifically made for lab work. The GUI can help control lasers, detectors, and piezos.
Furthermore, you can find code for communicating with most of the equipment in the lab.
The repository also includes a folder of projects where data and code for specific projects can be shared.
Finally, these projects could also be smaller code samples that could be useful for specific tasks.
